# Top Down Tank Game

I have always been interested in gaming, and I wanted to try my hand at making one.
This is the Basic Topdown Shooter game. 


Eventually I want to add the following:
-	~~Enemies~~
-	Obstacles
-	Scoring
-	Lives

I want to keep it simple with JS/HTML/CSS, but I may end up using React for UI purposes
